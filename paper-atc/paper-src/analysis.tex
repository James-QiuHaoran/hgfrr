\subsection{Proof of Broadcast Performance}

Consider a network of size $N$. All nodes in the network are geographically distributed evenly. In HGFRR, every $r$ nodes that are geographically near to each other will be gathered into a ring at the bottom level. If there are $c$ contact nodes in each ring at the bottom level, then the number of nodes elected to be the normal nodes at the second level will be: $$L(1) = \frac{cN}{r}$$ Then according to the protocol of HGFRR, the number of nodes elected to be the normal nodes at the next level will be the number of rings at the second level multiply with parameter $c$, which is: $$L(2) = \frac{c^2N}{r^2}$$ Recursively, the number of rings at level $h$ will be $$L(h) = \frac{c^hN}{r^h}$$ Let there be $t$ nodes in the top level (which are DNS seeds for a networked system), then the number of levels will be $$l = log_{\frac{c}{r}}{\frac{tc}{N}}$$

give a proof of time complexity and message comlexity of broadcast, node join and contact node election. Compare to current works.
