\subsection{Security Evaluation}

We uses WireShark \cite{chappell2010wireshark} to watch the packet sending out from a node and heading to the node. We counts three types of packets: around 17 kb, around 200 bytes, and less than 150 bytes, since they represents three types of messages correspondingly, i.e. the block, the transaction, and other messages including control messages or membership messages. We found that during one service term of a contact node, contact nodes of a ring cannot be differentiated from the normal nodes. By watching and recording for a long time, we found that the overall packet statistics show that all nodes have same percentages of sent and received three types of messages (See Table \ref{tab:packet1} and Table \ref{tab:packet2}). Therefore, due to the short service term of contact nodes and the similar percentages of all types of messages, it is hard for an outsider of the system to differentiate contact nodes from normal nodes.

\begin{table}
	\begin{tabular}{l*{6}{c}r}
		Node Type & $\sim17 KB$ & $\sim200 B$ & $<150 B$ \\
		\hline		
		Normal node in one term & 33.10\%	& 58.60\% & 5.90\% \\
		Contact node in one term & 34.00\%	& 61.20\% &4.50\%  \\
		Node at all time  & 33.70\%	& 60.90\% &4.60\%  \\
