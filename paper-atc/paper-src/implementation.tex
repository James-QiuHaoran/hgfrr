We have implemented \xxx in C++ with the only external dependence being \texttt{Protobuf}. The \xxx implementation contains roughly 3800 lines of code, not including tests, configuration on docker, comments and blank lines. An \xxx application running on a server (node) mainly includes three components, a \texttt{NodeTable}, a \texttt{PeerManager}, and a \texttt{Discoverer}. The \texttt{Discoverer} is responsible for bootstrapping the node. The \texttt{NodeTable} stores peer information at each level and maintains the network structure. The \texttt{PeerManager} deal with incoming messages and is responsible for broadcasting messages.

The source code of \xxx will be available at \texttt{github} \texttt{.com/hku-systems/hgfrr} if appropriate.
