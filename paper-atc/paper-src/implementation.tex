We have implemented \textsc{HGFRR} in C++. An HGFRR application running on a server mainly includes three components, a \texttt{NodeTable}, a \texttt{PeerManager}, and a \texttt{Discoverer}. The \texttt{Discoverer} is responsible for bootstrapping node. The \texttt{NodeTable} stores peer information at each level and maintains the network structure. The \texttt{PeerManager} deal with incoming messages and is responsible for broadcasting messages.

The source code of HGFRR will be available at \texttt{github} \texttt{.com/hku-systems/hgfrr}.
