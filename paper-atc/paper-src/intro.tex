This is the introduction.\\

Flow: \\
start from talking about current blockchain systems, transaction rate is getting increasing \\
$\rightarrow$
problem is: current blockchain systems are based on kademlia (dht) structure, which is efficient on node discovery and data look up, however, broadcast suffers traffic congesion and inefficient convergence (gossip)\\
$\rightarrow$
many improvements are made on gossip, not quite efficient, still suffers bandwidth problem\\
$\rightarrow$
less p2p network are designed for blockchain, talk about p2p networks in other domains\\
$\rightarrow$
analysis blockchain needs and those p2p networks does not fit\\
$\rightarrow$
moreover, current blockchain systems didn't address geographical feature\\
$\rightarrow$
moreover, current blockchain systems didn't address security problem from the p2p layer\\
$\rightarrow$
talk about hgfrr, give a overview, analysis result, implementation overview, evaluation result\\
$\rightarrow$
summarize our feature \& contributions\\
$\rightarrow$
paper structure overview
