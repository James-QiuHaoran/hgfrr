This paper identifies the problem of using Gossip in the P2P network layer of a blockchain system, which to some extent already became the bottleneck of further improving the transaction rate. Though tremendous work has been proposed in consensus layer to improve transaction rate, few work addressed the problem from the P2P network layer. \xxx makes use of the recursive structure to broadcast messages so that messages redundancy could be reduced to the lowest. \xxx also take the geographical locality of each node into consideration to further improve the efficiency of a broadcast operation. \xxx is robust even in a dynamic network environment and is hidden from outsiders. Although \xxx is not as robust as Gossip, it is evaluated and analyzed that the robustness of \xxx is sufficient in blockchain system context. By trading robustness, \xxx improves the throughput of blockchain systems by increasing broadcast efficiency. In the future, the transaction rate of the blockchain systems can be improved further in a low bandwidth-consumption or crowded network.
