# Evaluation Plan

## Analysis Compared to Ethereum P2P Network
- Ethereum P2P Network Breakdown: fair comparison - we are faster on doing the same work
- GFRR Component Analysis - each part has effects on what performance [Correctness Proof?]

## Time Complexity
Fixed node number: Time / # of messages/operations

## Message Complexity
Fixed node number: # of messages sent / # of operations

## Scalability
- Time / # of nodes (fixed # of messages/operations)
- Message / # of nodes (fixed # of operations)

## Protection to Routing/Node Anonymity

## Fault-tolerance
- Message Reachibility / Fault Ratio

## Maintainability
- Node Loss Recovery Time / # of existing nodes
- Node Join Boostrap Time / # of existing nodes

## Comparison Targets

- Kademlia
- Chord
- Pastry
- Tapestry
